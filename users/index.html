                    <p>我最近告诉 Y Combinator 的申请者，我可以给出的最好的建议是：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>说明一下你从用户那里学到了什么</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这可以检测到很多东西：你是否关注用户，你对用户的理解程度，甚至用户对你的产品的需要程度。</p>
<p>后来，我问自己同样的问题：我从 YC 的用户那里学到了什么？</p>
<p>我首先想到的是，大多数创业公司都面临同样的问题。没有问题是完全相同的，但令人惊讶的是，无论他们做什么，问题都是一样的。一旦你为 100 家创业公司提供建议，这些创业公司都在做不同的产品，但你很少会遇到你以前没见过的问题。</p>
<p>这个事实是 YC 能够成功的原因之一。但我们刚开始的时候并不知道。我只有几个参照点：我们自己的创业公司，以及一些朋友创办的公司。令我惊讶的是，<strong>同样的问题经常以不同的形式出现</strong>。许多后期投资者可能永远不会意识到这一点，因为后来的投资者在其整个职业生涯中可能不会有机会为 100 家创业公司提供建议，但 YC 的合伙人在头两年就可以获得这么多经验。</p>
<p>这是资助大量早期初创公司而不是少量已经发展起来的公司的一个优势。你会得到大量的数据。不仅仅是因为你目睹了更多的公司，而且还因为你看到了更多的公司出错。</p>
<p>但是，知道创业公司可能遇到的所有（几乎所有）问题，并不意味着可以为他们自动地提供建议，或者说简化成一个公式。与 YC 合伙人的单独办公还是必需的。每家创业公司都是独一无二的，这意味着必需由熟悉他们公司的合伙人提供建议。[1]</p>
<p>在 2012 年夏天，臭名昭著的“”事件中，让我们深刻地认识到了这一点。</p>
<p>We learned that the hard way, in the notorious &quot;batch that broke YC&quot; in the summer of 2012.</p>
<p>在那之前，我们一直把合伙人当做一个池子。当一个创业公司</p>
<p>Up till that point we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn't know all the companies yet. [<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html#f2n">2</a>]</p>
<p>At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had happened. We were using an <em>O(n2)</em> algorithm. So of course it blew up.</p>
<p>The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be.</p>
<p>Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk about some problem, and we'll discover another much bigger one in the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties they're having raising money, and after digging into their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still haven't cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out to be that their product isn't good enough. There have been times when I've asked &quot;Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built it?&quot; and the founders, on thinking about it, said &quot;No.&quot; Well, there's the reason you're having trouble getting users.</p>
<p>Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative importance. [<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html#f3n">3</a>] They'll come in to talk about three problems they're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed immediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and only mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door! Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die with some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the murderers are.</p>
<p>Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often founders don't listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting to see the pattern. &quot;They come back a year later,&quot; she said, &quot;and say 'We wish we'd listened to you.'&quot;</p>
<p>It took me a long time to figure out why founders don't listen. At first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That's part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is that so much about startups is <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html">counterintuitive</a>. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don't listen to us is that they don't <em>believe</em> us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise. [<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html#f4n">4</a>]</p>
<p>The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough, the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the things that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders wouldn't need our advice about how to do it.</p>
<p>Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results.</p>
<p>This doesn't imply that founders should rush forward regardless of the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there's less backtracking than you might expect. Founders usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because they'll talk about the results at office hours the next week. [<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html#f5n">5</a>]</p>
<p>A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and you can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the right one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes startups more startup-like.</p>
<p>Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.</p>
<p>Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what &quot;it&quot; is. Partly because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html">hacking the test</a> instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still see them reverting to their old habits.)</p>
<p>YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.</p>
<p>The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may be even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at history, great work clusters around certain places and institutions: Florence in the late 15th century, the University of Göttingen in the late 19th, <em>The New Yorker</em> under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC. However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else, because they're so starved for them in everyday life.</p>
<p>Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those famous clusters, it won't be for lack of trying. We were very aware of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be one. By this point it's not bragging to say that it's the biggest cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC concede that.</p>
<p>Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you'd expect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup.</p>
<p>One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without having to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some places means they're proportionally absent from the rest.</p>
<p>Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I've experienced. We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to talk to. When you have a whole roomful it's another thing entirely.</p>
<p>YC founders aren't just inspired by one another. They also help one another. That's the happiest thing I've learned about startup founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it. The result is something far more intense than, say, a university. Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.</p>
<p><strong>备注</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>[1] 这就是我为什么一直不喜欢人们把 YC 称之为“训练营”。它的强度像一个训练营，但在结构上却完全相反。并不是每个人都在做同样的事情，他们每个人都在和自己的 YC 合伙人谈话，然后根据自己的情况弄清楚到底需要什么。</p>
<p>[2] When I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt to the partners that something was wrong. Things weren't yet so broken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch did unusually well.</p>
<p>[3] This situation reminds me of the research showing that people are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how accurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar.</p>
<p>[4] The <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/airbnbs.html">Airbnbs</a> were particularly good at listening — partly because they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they'd had such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready to listen.</p>
<p>[5] The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you're solving. When you're negotiating with investors, it could be a couple days, whereas if you're building hardware it could be months.</p>
